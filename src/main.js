// story of game - you are a byte packet traveling through the internet trying to reach your destination.
// Starts off with a computer command being typed into a command line "GET /index.html HTTP/1.1/"
// Then the command is entered and your player is fired out onto the screen

// Controls - SPACE/MOUSE1 To fly
//            W, S To adjust speed (faster uses less power)
// Power pickups become less common as time goes on
